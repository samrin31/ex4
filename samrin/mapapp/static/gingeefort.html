            Gingee Fort, built during the 9th century by the Cholas and later 
            strengthened by the Vijayanagara rulers, is one of the most 
            remarkable forts in South India. Spread across three hillocks, 
            the fort is known for its massive walls, hidden passages, and 
            strategic architecture. It stands as a symbol of valor, history, 
            and architectural brilliance.
